Out and About 2

Hi and welcome to my personal website. I am a theoretical and computational physicist recently turned data scientist and on Jessicaâ€™s Blog I will be writing about small projects that I am working on and things that I find overall interesting from the data science world. Please feel free to also take a look at my LinkedIn Profile, my Github Profile or my recently started Kaggle Profile, which is unfortunately still relatively empty. I hope to change this soon.
