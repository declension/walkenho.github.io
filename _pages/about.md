"Ever tried, ever failed, no matter. Try again, fail again, fail better." (Samuel Beckett)

Hi and welcome to my personal website. I am a theoretical and computational physicist turned data scientist and here I write about my experiences in failing and failing better (and more importantly about what I learn on the way). 

Sometimes, I write about things that just interest me, sometimes I write about things that I found useful. Sometimes I might write down things mostly to get my head around them myself, sometimes I might write things downs for others. Topics might cover anything from 
code snippets to pieces of analysis or project-write ups. 

If you are interested in more information about my professional life, you can also take a look at my [github](https://github.com/walkenho) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-walkenhorst-809509a3/) profiles.
