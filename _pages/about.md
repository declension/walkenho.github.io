Hi and welcome to my personal website. I am a theoretical and computational physicist turned data scientist and here I
write about anything data-related. Sometimes, it might be things that just interest me, sometimes it might be things that I found useful. Sometimes I might write down things mostly to explain them to myself, sometimes I might write things downs for others. Things might vary between anything from writing down an instruction to use a particular piece of code to pieces of analysis or project-write ups. 

If you are interested in further info, you can also take a look at my [github](https://github.com/walkenho) or at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-walkenhorst-809509a3/) profiles.

Whatever it might be that made you come here, I hope that you will find something of use for you, too.
